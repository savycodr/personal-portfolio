# personal-portfolio
A portfolio to display my projects, resume, and contact information.

## Instructions

* This is a single page portfolio. There is a menu button on the upper left side for easier traversal. 

* In the ABOUT section of the website there is a link to email me. There are also links to my Github and Linkedin accounts. There is a link to my resume.

* In the PORTFOLIO section there is a card for each of my projects. If you click on the card's image, it will appear larger. You can click on a link to see the projec's code in Github. You can also click on a link to the deployed application.

## Technology

* This webpage uses Materialize's CSS and javascript library.

* I used colormind.io to design the color scheme.

* Utilizes a google font called Arimo by Steve Matteson.

## Future Enhancements

* I would like to affix the menu to the top right corner as the page scrolls. Currently, the user must go to the top of the page to find the menu button.
